      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Learn more about our mission to make Python learning accessible and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>SOYA was founded by a group of passionate students who saw the potential of combining their skills to change the way people learn to code. 
        We noticed that traditional learning methods often left students feeling overwhelmed and disengaged. 
        By using game-like elements such as levels, rankings, and quizzes, we have turned Python learning into a captivating journey.</p>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a world where learning to code is not just a skill but a thrilling adventure. We aim to empower individuals with the knowledge and confidence to pursue their passions, 
        build innovative solutions, and make a positive impact on the world. At PyLearn, we are committed to creating a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that fosters creativity, collaboration, and continuous growth.
      Thank you for choosing PyLearn as your Python learning partner. We are excited to embark on this journey with you and help you achieve your coding goals. Let's start this adventure together!</p>
