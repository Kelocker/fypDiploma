# Steps-to-Run-the-Project

1. **Create Virtual Environment**  
   In the project root, create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment**  
   Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Restart Terminal**  
   If necessary, restart the terminal after installing dependencies.

5. **Activate Virtual Environment Again (If Needed)**  
   In case the virtual environment isn't active after restarting, activate it using one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   venvat
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

6. **Split Terminal**  
   Open a split terminal to run the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

7. **Start Frontend**  
   In the first terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

8. **Start Backend**  
   In the second terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   Start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. **Open the Browser**  
   Once both servers are running, open any browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
10. **Open the serverside of SOYA**
    open any browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    ```
